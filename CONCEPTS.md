## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a **distributed ledger** that stores data in **blocks** linked together using **cryptographic hashes**. Think of it as a digital chain where each link (block) is connected to the previous one in a way that makes tampering extremely difficult to hide.

### Key Properties

1. **Immutability**: Once data is written to the blockchain, it's extremely difficult to change
2. **Transparency**: All participants can verify the entire history
3. **Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure
4. **Chronological Order**: Blocks are timestamped and ordered sequentially

### Block Structure

Each block in PyChain contains:

```python
Block {
    index: 0,                          # Position in chain (genesis = 0)
    timestamp: 1696512345.678,         # Unix timestamp
    transactions: [Transaction...],     # List of transactions
    previous_hash: "0abc123...",       # Link to previous block
    hash: "00def456...",               # This block's identifier
    nonce: 12345,                      # Proof of work nonce
    difficulty: 2                      # Mining difficulty
}
```

### Genesis Block

The first block in every blockchain is special - it's called the **genesis block**:
- Has no previous block (previous_hash = "0")
- Index is always 0
- Contains a single genesis transaction from "System" to "Genesis"
- Must be mined like any other block

```python
blockchain = Blockchain(difficulty=2)
# Genesis block is automatically created and mined
print(blockchain.chain[0].previous_hash)  # "0"
```

## Cryptographic Hashing

**Hashing** is the process of converting input data of any size into a fixed-size string using a mathematical function. PyChain uses **SHA-256** (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit).

### SHA-256 Properties

1. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
   ```python
   hash("Hello") == hash("Hello")  # Always true
   ```

2. **Fixed Length**: Output is always 64 hexadecimal characters (256 bits)
   ```python
   len(hashlib.sha256(b"Hi").hexdigest())       # 64
   len(hashlib.sha256(b"Very long text...").hexdigest())  # 64
   ```

3. **Avalanche Effect**: Small input change completely changes output
   ```
   Input: "Hello"
   Hash:  185f8db32271fe25f561a6fc938b2e264306ec304eda518007d1764826381969

   Input: "hello"  (just changed case!)
   Hash:  2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
   ```

4. **One-Way Function**: Cannot reverse hash to get original data
   - Easy to compute hash from data
   - Computationally infeasible to find data from hash

5. **Collision Resistant**: Extremely hard to find two different inputs with same hash
   - Would require trying 2^128 combinations on average
   - More than all atoms in the observable universe

### How Blocks Use Hashing

Each block's hash is calculated from ALL its contents:

```python
def calculate_hash(self):
    # Combine all block data into one string
    block_string = (
        str(self.index) +
        str(self.timestamp) +
        str([tx.to_dict() for tx in self.transactions]) +
        str(self.previous_hash) +
        str(self.nonce) +
        str(self.difficulty)
    )

    # Calculate SHA-256 hash
    return hashlib.sha256(block_string.encode()).hexdigest()
```

This means:
- Changing **any** data changes the hash
- Each block's hash depends on previous block's hash
- Tampering with any block breaks the entire chain

## Proof of Work

**Proof of Work (PoW)** is a consensus mechanism that makes creating blocks computationally expensive, thereby securing the blockchain against spam and tampering.

### How It Works

The miner must find a **nonce** (number used once) that, when combined with block data, produces a hash meeting the difficulty requirement.

**Difficulty Requirement**: Hash must start with N zeros (where N = difficulty)

```python
difficulty = 3
# Valid hash must start with: "000..."
# Examples:
#   "000abc123..." ✅ Valid
#   "00abc1234..." ❌ Invalid (only 2 zeros)
#   "abc000123..." ❌ Invalid (zeros not at start)
```

### Mining Process

```python
def mine_block(self):
    target = "0" * self.difficulty  # e.g., "00" for difficulty 2

    while self.hash[:self.difficulty] != target:
        self.nonce += 1  # Try next nonce
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    # Found valid hash!
    return mining_time
```

The miner tries nonce values: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... until finding one that works.

### Difficulty Scaling

The probability of any hash starting with N zeros is `1 / (16^N)`:

| Difficulty | Target Pattern | Probability | Avg Attempts | Time (@1M/sec) |
|------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | 0... | 1/16 | 16 | ~instant |
| 2 | 00... | 1/256 | 256 | ~instant |
| 3 | 000... | 1/4,096 | 4,096 | ~instant |
| 4 | 0000... | 1/65,536 | 65,536 | ~0.06s |
| 5 | 00000... | 1/1,048,576 | 1,048,576 | ~1s |
| 6 | 000000... | 1/16,777,216 | 16,777,216 | ~17s |

Each difficulty increase makes mining 16× harder!

### Why Proof of Work?

1. **Cost to Attack**: Tampering requires re-mining all subsequent blocks
2. **Spam Prevention**: Creating blocks requires computational work
3. **Decentralization**: Anyone with computing power can mine
4. **Trustless**: Don't need to trust miners - work speaks for itself

Example attack scenario:
```python
# Attacker wants to change block 5 in a 100-block chain

# Step 1: Modify block 5
blockchain.chain[5].data = "Fraudulent data"

# Step 2: Re-mine block 5 (takes time...)
blockchain.chain[5].mine_block()

# Step 3: Block 6's previous_hash is now wrong!
# Must re-mine block 6... and 7... and 8... all the way to 100!

# Meanwhile, honest miners added blocks 101, 102, 103...
# Attacker can never catch up!
```

## Chain Validation and Security

The blockchain validates four critical aspects to ensure integrity.

### 1. Hash Integrity

Each block's stored hash must match its calculated hash:

```python
# Check hash hasn't been tampered
if block.hash != block.calculate_hash():
    return False  # Hash mismatch detected!
```

**Why this matters**: If someone changes block data without re-mining, this check catches it immediately.

### 2. Chain Continuity

Each block's `previous_hash` must match the previous block's `hash`:

```python
# Check chain link is intact
if block.previous_hash != blockchain.chain[i-1].hash:
    return False  # Broken link detected!
```

**Why this matters**: This creates the "chain" in blockchain. Breaking any link is immediately visible.

### 3. Proof of Work Verification

Each block's hash must meet its difficulty requirement:

```python
# Check proof of work
target = "0" * block.difficulty
if block.hash[:block.difficulty] != target:
    return False  # Insufficient proof of work!
```

**Why this matters**: Ensures each block required computational work to create.

### 4. Transaction Validation

All transactions must be valid (sufficient balance, valid structure):

```python
# Reconstruct balances up to this block
balances = calculate_balances_up_to(block)

# Check each transaction
for tx in block.transactions:
    if balances[tx.sender] < tx.amount:
        return False  # Insufficient balance!
```

**Why this matters**: Prevents double-spending and invalid transactions.

### Security Guarantees

When all four validations pass:
1. **Authenticity**: Each block was legitimately mined
2. **Integrity**: No data has been tampered with
3. **Chronology**: Blocks are in correct sequential order
4. **Consistency**: All transactions are valid at time of mining

## Transaction System

Transactions represent the transfer of value between addresses in the blockchain.

### Transaction Structure

```python
Transaction {
    sender: "Alice",                # Who is sending
    receiver: "Bob",                # Who is receiving
    amount: 50.0,                   # How much
    timestamp: 1696512345.678,      # When created
    transaction_id: "a1b2c3..."     # Unique identifier (hash)
}
```

### Transaction Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: User creates transaction
2. **Validation**: System validates sender has sufficient balance
3. **Pending Pool**: Valid transaction added to pending pool
4. **Mining**: Miner includes transaction in new block
5. **Confirmation**: Block is added to chain
6. **Finality**: Transaction is now immutable

```python
# 1. Create transaction
tx = blockchain.create_transaction("Alice", "Bob", 50)

# 2. Transaction is validated automatically
# 3. Added to pending_transactions pool

# 4 & 5. Mine block
block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions("Miner1")

# 6. Transaction is now permanent!
```

### Balance Tracking

Balances are calculated by summing all transactions:

```python
def get_balance(address):
    balance = initial_balances.get(address, 0)

    # Add all incoming transactions
    for block in chain:
        for tx in block.transactions:
            if tx.receiver == address:
                balance += tx.amount
            if tx.sender == address:
                balance -= tx.amount

    return balance
```

### Transaction Validation Rules

A transaction is valid when:
1. **Amount > 0**: Cannot send zero or negative amounts
2. **Sender ≠ Receiver**: Cannot send to yourself
3. **Sufficient Balance**: Sender has enough funds (including pending transactions)
4. **Valid Structure**: All required fields present and correct type

```python
# Valid transaction
tx = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 50)
valid, msg = tx.is_valid()  # (True, None)

# Invalid transactions
tx1 = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 0)      # Amount = 0
tx2 = Transaction("Alice", "Alice", 50)   # Same sender/receiver
tx3 = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", -10)    # Negative amount
```

### Mining Rewards

Miners receive rewards for successfully mining blocks:

```python
# When mining, a reward transaction is automatically added
reward_tx = Transaction("System", miner_address, mining_reward)

# "System" is special - can create value without balance check
```

This incentivizes miners to:
- Process transactions
- Secure the network
- Maintain the blockchain

### Double-Spending Prevention

The blockchain prevents double-spending through balance validation:

```python
blockchain = Blockchain(initial_balances={"Alice": 100})

# Alice tries to spend money twice
blockchain.create_transaction("Alice", "Bob", 80)    # OK
blockchain.create_transaction("Alice", "Charlie", 80)  # FAIL!
# ValueError: Insufficient balance: Alice has 20, but trying to send 80
```

Even with pending transactions, total spending cannot exceed balance.

## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

The blockchain automatically adjusts mining difficulty to maintain a target block time, similar to how Bitcoin adjusts every 2016 blocks.

### Why Adjust Difficulty?

Without adjustment:
- More miners → faster blocks → inflation
- Fewer miners → slower blocks → network slowdown

With adjustment:
- Network adapts to changing hashrate
- Consistent block production
- Predictable transaction confirmation times

### Adjustment Algorithm

```python
def adjust_difficulty():
    # Only adjust at intervals (e.g., every 5 blocks)
    if len(chain) % adjustment_interval != 0:
        return current_difficulty

    # Calculate average time for last N blocks
    recent_blocks = chain[-adjustment_interval:]
    avg_time = average_time_between(recent_blocks)

    # Compare to target
    if avg_time < 0.75 * target_time:
        # Too fast - increase difficulty
        return min(max_difficulty, difficulty + 1)
    elif avg_time > 1.5 * target_time:
        # Too slow - decrease difficulty
        return max(min_difficulty, difficulty - 1)
    else:
        # Just right - maintain difficulty
        return difficulty
```

### Example Adjustment

```
Target: 10 seconds per block
Interval: Every 5 blocks

Blocks 1-5: Mined in 5, 6, 4, 5, 5 seconds (avg = 5s)
→ Too fast! Increase difficulty from 2 to 3

Blocks 6-10: Mined in 12, 15, 13, 11, 14 seconds (avg = 13s)
→ Too slow! Decrease difficulty from 3 to 2

Blocks 11-15: Mined in 9, 10, 11, 10, 10 seconds (avg = 10s)
→ Just right! Maintain difficulty at 2
```

### Bounds and Safety

The system enforces minimum and maximum difficulty:

```python
MIN_DIFFICULTY = 1   # Prevent too-easy mining
MAX_DIFFICULTY = 8   # Prevent too-hard mining
```

This prevents:
- **Difficulty 0**: Would accept any hash (no security)
- **Excessive Difficulty**: Blocks would take hours to mine

## Blockchain Structure

### Memory Representation

```python
Blockchain {
    chain: [Block, Block, Block, ...],
    pending_transactions: [Tx, Tx, ...],
    difficulty: 2,
    target_block_time: 10,
    adjustment_interval: 5,
    initial_balances: {"Alice": 100, ...},
    mining_reward: 10
}
```

### Chain Growth

```
Genesis → Block 1 → Block 2 → Block 3 → ...
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
  0000...   00a1b...  0034c...  007de...
```

Each arrow represents the `previous_hash` link.

### Adding a New Block

```python
# 1. Create transactions
blockchain.create_transaction("Alice", "Bob", 50)

# 2. Mine block
block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions("Miner1")

# What happens:
# a) Get pending transactions
# b) Add mining reward transaction
# c) Create new block with:
#    - index = last_block.index + 1
#    - timestamp = now
#    - transactions = pending + reward
#    - previous_hash = last_block.hash
#    - difficulty = adjusted difficulty
# d) Mine block (find valid nonce)
# e) Add block to chain
# f) Clear pending transactions
```

## Security Properties

### Tamper-Evidence

**Property**: Any modification to historical data is detectable

**Implementation**:
- Changing block data changes its hash
- Changed hash breaks next block's `previous_hash` link
- Broken link detected by validation

**Example**:
```python
# Tamper with block 5
blockchain.chain[5].data = "Fraudulent"

# Validation fails!
blockchain.is_chain_valid()  # False
# Error: Block 6 broken chain link
```

### Computational Security

**Property**: Rewriting history requires enormous computational work

**Implementation**:
- Each block requires proof of work
- Tampering requires re-mining that block + all subsequent blocks
- While re-mining, honest chain grows longer

**Attack Cost**: Exponential with chain length

### Fork Resolution

When two valid chains exist, **longest chain wins**:
```
                    ┌─ Block 11a
Common → Block 10  ─┤
                    └─ Block 11b → Block 12b

Blockchain chooses: Block 11b → Block 12b (longer)
```

This prevents attackers with less than 51% hashrate from succeeding.

### Immutability Through Growth

The more blocks added after a transaction, the more secure it becomes:

| Confirmations | Security Level | Time (@10s/block) |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 block | Low | 10 seconds |
| 6 blocks | Medium | 1 minute |
| 12 blocks | High | 2 minutes |
| 100 blocks | Very High | ~17 minutes |

Bitcoin waits for 6 confirmations (~1 hour) for high-value transactions.

## Summary

PyChain demonstrates these core blockchain concepts:

1. **Blocks**: Data containers linked by cryptographic hashes
2. **Hashing**: SHA-256 provides integrity and linking mechanism
3. **Proof of Work**: Makes block creation costly, securing the chain
4. **Validation**: Four-part check ensures integrity and authenticity
5. **Transactions**: Value transfer with balance validation
6. **Difficulty Adjustment**: Adapts to maintain consistent block times

These concepts work together to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-evident ledger without requiring trust in any single party.

For hands-on learning, try modifying the PyChain code to:
- Change the hashing algorithm
- Implement a different consensus mechanism
- Add additional validation rules
- Create a new transaction type

Understanding these fundamentals is key to grasping how real blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum work!
